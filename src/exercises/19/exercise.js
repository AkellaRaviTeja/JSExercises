/*
Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
Prototypes are a powerful and very flexible feature of JavaScript, making it possible to reuse
code and combine objects.
Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype 
is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. 
The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
__proto__ is one of the function of prototype
