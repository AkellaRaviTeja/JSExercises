// Debugger is a keyword that stops the execution of the code and allows you to inspect the current state of the code. It is useful for debugging purposes.

/*Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors within a script. 
  A breakpoint is a point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution.
  While the code is paused, we can examine current variables, execute commands in the console etc. In other words, we can debug it.

  Watch – shows current values for any expressions.(You can click the plus + and input an expression. The debugger will show its value, automatically recalculating it in the process of execution.)

  Call Stack – shows the nested calls chain.

  Scope – current variables.
  Local shows local function variables. You can also see their values highlighted right over the source.
  Global has global variables (out of any functions).
