// What is debugger;
// - Comment your understanding of it.
// - Paste the link of the MDN article here.


// In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.

// At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.

// After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).

// The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.

// This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.

// If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.
