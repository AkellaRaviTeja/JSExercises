/**
 * Debugger is a keyword in js
 *      - debugger
 * it invokes all the debugging functionalities if present.
 * we can use it like a breakpoint to stop the execution at the given point.
 * and if any debugger methods are available it runs those functions and then it continues execution 
 * if no debugger functions are available then it has no effect.
